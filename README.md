# Chat-Aplication
The project not only tries to implement a chat application based on client-server architecture, but it also attempts to implement a secure channel  where the server and clients can communicate safely. 
The data sent to the server by clients as well as what the server sends to clients is encrypted 
using vignere cipher to ensure secure 
communication.
